After installing, run the server using

```
$ npm run start
```


If instead, you get something like the following, someone is already
using the default port of 8080:

    Server running at http://127.0.0.1:8080/

    events.js:72
        throw er; // Unhandled 'error' event
                  ^
    Error: listen EADDRINUSE
        at errnoException (net.js:901:11)
        at Server._listen2 (net.js:1039:14)
        at listen (net.js:1061:10)
        at Server.listen (net.js:1127:5)
        ...

Once the server is running, test it by visiting the following URL in your
browser:

    http://localhost:8080/
